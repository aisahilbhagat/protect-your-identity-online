# <span style="color:#4CAF50;">Use a Duck Address with Temp Mail</span><br>
### <span style="color:#9CDCFE;">Fast, Privacy-Friendly Login Trick</span>

</div>

A lightweight workaround for logging into websites that require email verification when you’re using **public or untrusted computers** (school labs, libraries, cyber cafés, etc.).<br>
Pair a temporary inbox with **DuckDuckGo Email Protection** and receive OTPs/verification links **without exposing your real email**.

---

## <span style="color:#F78C6C;">✨ Why this Works</span>
- <span style="color:#C3E88D;">Keep your real email out of public machines</span> — no sign-in required.
- <span style="color:#FFCB6B;">Temp-mail gets blocked often</span> — Duck addresses usually don’t.
- <span style="color:#89DDFF;">Receive OTPs and verification links normally</span> through the temp-mail inbox.

---

## <span style="color:#82AAFF;">📦 What You Need</span>
- Any temporary email provider with an inbox (example: `temp-mail.org`)
- DuckDuckGo Email Protection: https://duckduckgo.com/email

---

## <span style="color:#C792EA;">🚀 Quick Steps</span>
1. Open a temp-mail site and copy the temporary email address.
2. Visit DuckDuckGo Email Protection: https://duckduckgo.com/email
3. Click **Get Started → Next → Next**.
4. Pick any Duck address (e.g., `randomname@duck.com`).
5. When asked where emails should be forwarded, paste the temp-mail address.
6. Check your temp-mail inbox for the Duck verification code.
7. Enter the code to complete verification.
8. You’ll see a confirmation that your Duck address is ready.
9. Use `yourname@duck.com` on websites; OTPs arrive in the temp-mail inbox.

## <span style="color:#FF5370;">📝 Notes</span>
- Duck forwarding often bypasses blocked temp-mail domains.
- Ideal for one-time or short-term access.
- If something breaks, switch to a different temp-mail provider.
